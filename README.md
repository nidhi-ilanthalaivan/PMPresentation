This weather forecasting project aims to predict future temperature trends based on historical data using time series analysis. The project begins with data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for modeling. It explores temperature patterns and correlations through exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by the development of a basic forecasting model using a 30-day moving average. Model performance is evaluated with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results suggest that the model provides reasonable accuracy in forecasting temperature trends. This project contributes to understanding weather patterns and serves as a foundation for more advanced forecasting models.
